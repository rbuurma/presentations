<section style="text-align: left;">Replacing "How something is made, with a view to finding out what it is" with "How something is made, with a view to making it again" - the Essence with the Preparation - is linked to an option that's completely antiscientific: in reality, the starting point of the Fantasy [of the critic's writing of a novel] isn't the Novel (in general, as a genre), but one or two novels out of thousands.

<section style="text-align: left;">1. In its most elevated conception (Dante, Mallarme, Proust), The Book is a representation of the universe; the book is homologous to the world. To want the "architectural and premeditated" Book is to conceive of and to want One universe, one that's structured, hierarchically ordered.
<br>
<br>
2. In its way, the Album represents the opposite: a universe that is not-one, not-ordered, scattered, a pure interweaving of contingencies, with no transcendence.
