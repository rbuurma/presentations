## some ways humanists think about information

---

> When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results. This is not how humanists think of the material they work with.

<small>Miriam Posner, ["Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction"](http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/)</small>

---

> In the twentieth century, the difficulty of representing unstructured text divided the quantitative social sciences from the humanities. Sociologists could use numbers to understand social mobility or inequality, but they had a hard time connecting those equations to the larger and richer domain of human discourse. Over the last twenty years, that barrier has fallen. A theory of learning that emphasizes generalization has shown researchers how to train models that have thousands of variables without creating the false precision called "overfitting." That conceptual advance would be interesting in itself. But it also allows researchers to include qualitative evidence like text in a quantitative model by the simple expedient of using lots of variables (say, one for each word). Social scientists can now connect structured social evidence to loosely structured texts or images or sounds, and theyâ€™re discovering that this connection opens up fascinating questions. Humanists are discovering the same thing.

## contingent models: topology

---

> We are interested in the extent to which the language of a particular work or concept...circulates within a given environment and structures a given literary field. Rather than look at only those works that claim to be Wertherian, we are interested in mapping Werther's discursive presence in a more diffuse, less explicit sense.

---

> ...reading topologically illustrates the way a contingent object brings into view a contingent environment, which is then used recursively to interpret that initial object. Not only are there other Wertherisms lurking in our topology waiting to be uncovered; there are other Wertherisms waiting to be brought to light when we model Werther differently.
