The Argument So Far:

---

+ Concerns for form over content kill love

---

+ Atomization & measurement kill joy

---

+ Both lead to surveillance and the casual acceptance of the same

---

+ Resulting in what we see in our classrooms.

---

...and the 'essay' is the prime vector.

Let us `essayer` something else.

Acknowledge the weird.

Note:
this is where I talk about unessays, about bashing stuff together to see what happens. If we recognize that 'visualizing' and 'essays' are just metaphors, then that makes us see they have a grammar, a form; and if we break away from that we have to establish a new form, a new grammar, and in this, we see things new.

---

"How do we write good history?"
<br>
...we bash it into a different form.

The only thing worse than writing a 5 pg essay is **not** writing a 5 pg essay.

---

Bashing history upsets the game. 

---

This is good.
<br>
<br> Lack of grammar for the other modalities is an opportunity to figure out new ways of knowing, to 'see' things afresh.

Note:
photobashing ... occupies a liminal position in archae because it puts 'something captured through a mechanical process through a subjective one'
Value in it- because it 'sit[s] at an intersection of subjective processes and mechanical capture, allows for some interesting interactions and reflexivity between both sides of this discussion'. Photobashing is deformation.
