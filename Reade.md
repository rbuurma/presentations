### Rereading Victorian Realism with Roland Barthes

---

> Replacing "How something is made, with a view to finding out what it is" with "How something is made, with a view to making it again" - the Essence with the Preparation - is linked to an option that's completely antiscientific: in reality, the starting point of the Fantasy [of the critic’s writing of a novel] isn't the Novel (in general, as a genre), but one or two novels out of thousands.

Roland Barthes, The Preparation of the Novel, Session of December 9, 1978, 13

---

> 1. In its most elevated conception (Dante, Mallarme, Proust), The Book is a representation of the universe; the book is homologous to the world. To want the “architectural and premeditated” Book is to conceive of and to want One universe, one that's structured, hierarchically ordered…
> 2. In its way, the Album represents the opposite: a universe that is not-one, not-ordered, scattered, a pure interweaving of contingencies, with no transcendence.

Roland Barthes, The Preparation of the Novel, Session of December 9, 1978, 189

> In a snowy villa, with a sloping lawn, just outside the great commercial
seaport, Barkington, there lived a few years ago a happy family. A
lady, middle-aged, but still charming; two young friends of hers; and a
periodical visitor.
<br>
<br>
> The lady was Mrs. Dodd; her occasional visitor was her husband; her
friends were her son Edward, aged twenty, and her daughter Julia,
nineteen, the fruit of a misalliance.

Charles Reade, *Hard Cash*, first page

> But the point for us is the way in which the novel – once a light and almost a frivolous thing – had come to be taken with the utmost seriousness – had in fact ceased to be light literature at all, and begun to require rigorous and elaborate training and preparation in the writer, perhaps even something of the athletes's processes in the reader. Fielding himself took novel-writing by no means lightly, and Richardson still less so: but imagine either, imagine Scott or even Miss Austen, going through the preliminary processes which seemed necessary, in different ways, to Charles Reade and to Mary Ann Evans!

George Saintsbury, The History of English Literature, 1913

>It is the charm of useless knowledge. Reade was a man of what one might call penny-encyclopaedic learning. He possessed vast stocks of disconnected information which a lively narrative gift allowed him to cram into books which would at any rate pass as novels. If you have the sort of mind that takes a pleasure in dates, lists, catalogues, concrete details, descriptions of processes, junk-shop windows and back numbers of the Exchange and Mart, the sort of mind that likes knowing exactly how a medieval catapult worked or just what objects a prison cell of the eighteen-forties contained, then you can hardly help enjoying Reade.

George Orwell, “Charles Reade,” 1940
